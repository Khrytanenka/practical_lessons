sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field


Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny


Fix me a drink, make it a strong one,
Hey comrade, a drink, make it a long one,
My hands are shaking and my feet are numb,
My head is aching and the bar's going round,
And I'm so down, in this foreign town
